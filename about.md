# Sarah Wu
Mechanical Engineering @ University of Washington
<br><br>
I'm an engineering student specializing in controls, product design, and mechatronics. I'm passionate about making engineering more accessible and widespread through STEM education. 
<br><br>
Outside of work, I like illustrating, rock climbing, scrapbooking, hip hop dancing, playing rhythm games (project sekai!), and drinking banana cream matcha.

#### What CAD software do you use?

I started off with Onshape in my FRC team but have been quickly converted to Solidworks. Despite the frequent crashes and errors, the wide variety of features it has is really helpful when designing and analyzing any complicated part or assembly.

#### What drove you to pursue engineering?

My childhood dream was to become an inventor. In my mind I was picturing a mad scientist trapping herself in a basement until she came up with a revolutionary product. Over time, I learned that innovation is gradual and based on teamwork. That's still what drives me to create. Incremental improvement and the opportunity to work with other creative engineers.
