# Sarah Wu
Mechanical Engineering @ University of Washington
<br><br>
I'm an engineering student specializing in controls, product design, and mechatronics. I'm passionate about making engineering more accessible and widespread through STEM education. 
<br><br>
Outside of work, I like illustrating, rock climbing, scrapbooking, hip hop dancing, playing rhythm games (project sekai!), and drinking banana cream matcha.
