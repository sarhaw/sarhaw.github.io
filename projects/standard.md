## Standard
![Standard CAD](/img/Standard/CAD.png)

The 2025 Standard robot is a stationary turret on top of a constantly spinning chassis. The drive train is omni wheel x drive mounted on four bar suspension. 

### Chassis
Reduced chassis weight and increased rotation speed from 1hz to 2.5hz and integrated multiple subsystems in robot chassis. Utilized skills with carbon fiber composites, additive manufacturing, and sheet metal to balance strength, manufacturability, and weight.
The robot chassis consisted of aluminum box tubes and carbon fiber plates. This allowed me to integrate everything into one simplified chassis.
The bumper was made by bending 0.75in box tubes into two 580mm diameter semicircles. It effectively protected our robot, ensuring that there were no mechanical failures during competition.

#### Carbon Fiber Manufacturing

The team created layups and routed all the carbon fiber used for the robots. Cutting the carbon fiber was an extensive process, with each session taking 4-5 hours and only producing 1 or 2 sheets. 

### Dividers
Rapidly prototyped and iteratively designed	 spring-tensioned dividers using ABS sheets and 3D printed TPU to decrease competitionâ€™s computer vision detection rate, with eventual implementation on multiple UW robots. 

### Driver
Driver for 2025 RMNA 1v1 competition developing custom effective strategies, resulting in 3rd place.
