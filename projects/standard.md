## Standard
![Standard CAD](/img/Standard/CAD.png)

The 2025 Standard robot is a stationary turret on top of a constantly spinning chassis. The drive train is omni wheel x drive mounted on four bar suspension. It includes bent box tube bumpers, a box tube and carbon fiber layers chassis frame, computer vision through an Intel Realsense, 2 bar linkage system for pitch, custom cut and bent ABS covers

### Chassis

I worked on the chassis subsystem, where I reduced chassis weight and increased rotation speed from 1hz to 2.5hz while integrating multiple subsystems in robot chassis. We used a mixture of CF composites, box tube, sheet metal, and ASA 3D prints for our structure, opting for weight yet being very rigid. 
The bumper was made by bending 0.75in box tubes into two 580mm diameter semicircles. It effectively protected our robot, ensuring that there were no mechanical failures during competition. 

### Manufacturing

For carbon fiber, the team created layups and routed all the carbon fiber used for the robots. Cutting the carbon fiber was an extensive process, with each session taking 4-5 hours and only producing 1 or 2 sheets. 

Standard Squad spent many long hours in the machine shop, on the lathe, mill, and bandsaw. We had a sponsor waterjet our sheet metal. 



### Dividers

I rapidly prototyped and iteratively designed	 spring-tensioned dividers using ABS sheets and 3D printed TPU to decrease competitionâ€™s computer vision detection rate. I went through dozens of iterations with only a couple weeks left until robots ship, but I was able to create a design that withstood golf ball shots and still sprung back to center. 

### Driver
I was selected as the driver for 2025 RMNA 1v1 competition. I had about a week, right before robots got shipped, to learn the keybinds, strategy, and how to fix common problems. During the competition, I worked hard to develop custom strategies for each team while contributing to robot fixes. This resulted in our team placing third in the 1v1 competition.
